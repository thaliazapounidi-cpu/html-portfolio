<h2>ðŸŒ± What is Diglett?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Species: Mole PokÃ©mon</li>
    <li>Type: Ground</li>
    <li>PokÃ©dex Number: #050</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Diglett is a small, brown PokÃ©mon that looks like a little head sticking out of the ground, with a big pink nose and beady eyes. Its body is mostly hidden beneath the soil - thatâ€™s why you only see the top part.</p>
  
  <p>Diglett spends most of its life underground, where it feeds on plant roots and loosens soil for farming. Although small (0.2 m tall), it is remarkably fast at tunneling. Its soft body is adapted to subterranean life, and only its head is typically visible above ground. Trainers prize Diglett for its speed and immunity to Electric-type moves. At level 26, it evolves into Dugtrio. In the Alola region, a unique Diglett form exists with metallic hair-like whiskers, making it Ground/Steel type.</p>
