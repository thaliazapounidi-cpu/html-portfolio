<p>The Lord of the Rings trilogy is considered one of the greatest achievements in cinema because it combines epic storytelling, unforgettable characters, and groundbreaking visuals. Peter Jackson brought Tolkien’s world to life with breathtaking landscapes, detailed world-building, and a powerful score by Howard Shore. The story balances action and emotion, showing themes of friendship, sacrifice, and hope. Winning 17 Oscars (including 11 for Return of the King), it set the standard for modern fantasy films.</p>

<h3>Ratatouille</h3>

<p>Pixar’s Ratatouille tells the story of Remy, a rat who dreams of becoming a chef in Paris despite being judged for who he is. The film stands out for its beautiful animation of food and the city, its inspiring message that “anyone can cook,” and its deeper theme about following your passion no matter the obstacles. It’s both funny and heartfelt, making it one of Pixar’s most beloved and meaningful films.</p>

<h3>The Goonies</h3>
